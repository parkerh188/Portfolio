This Power BI file is a project that I created for the Harn Museum. It is a dashboard to record attendance data and other metrics that is meant to be used as a public facing model on the Harn Museum website. Its other function is to be shown to potential donors to the museum, providing them an accurate depiction of the growth that the Harn has consistently shown for many years and encouraging them to invest and donate.
